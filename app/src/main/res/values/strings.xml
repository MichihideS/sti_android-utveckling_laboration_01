        Honkai star rail is a turn-based role-playing game that is published by the incredibly
        popular chinese company called miHoYo. It has a typical gacha monetization system in which
        players can obtain characters and weapons for a form of currency which can be obtained
        freely in the game but also purchased for real money for the people that enjoy doing that.
        The game itself is very sci-fi themed in which you go around and do different missions in
        different regions trying your best to calm the war in universe travelling through the
        vast space.
