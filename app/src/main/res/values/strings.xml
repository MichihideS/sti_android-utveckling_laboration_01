        Honkai star rail is a turn-based role-playing game that is published by the incredibly
        popular chinese company called miHoYo. It has a typical gacha monetization system in which
        players can obtain characters and weapons for a form of currency which can be obtained
        freely in the game but also purchased for real money for the people that enjoy doing that.
        The game itself is very sci-fi themed in which you go around and do different missions in
        different regions trying your best to calm the war in universe travelling through the
        vast space.

        Here you can try your luck at the so called gacha system! Basically you simulate a
        10 draw which means you draw from the pool of available items 10 times. The rates are as
        abysmal as they are in the real game so there is a 0.6% chance of drawing a 5* and a 5.1%
        chance of drawing a 4* and a massive 94.3% chance of drawing a 3*. The stars are more or
        less just showing how good something is, 5* being super good and 3* being really not
        useful. Good luck!
